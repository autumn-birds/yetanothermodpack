# rosegard, 1.18 version

an experimental, single-player-first modpack in the mostly prototype stage.  the only documentation is this readme file.  you probably shouldn't play this, even if you somehow have access

design goals:

- gardening
- vibrant world
- player fulfilment
- gameplay that's slow but is gentle (making things grow) rather than grindy
- things to tinker with, but not frustratingly puzzle-gated progression
- a nether that's foreboding due to its sheer overgrown density above all else

design non-goals, things i don't care about:

- "good balance" by multiplayer-server standards, or by vanilla purist standards, or by "expert mode pack" standards
- realism

gotchas & tips & tricks:

- the nether coordinate scaling you may be used to from vanilla isn't a thing here.  implied: nether transportation is no faster than the same transportation in the overworld.
